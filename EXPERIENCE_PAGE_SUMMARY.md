## üìã Next Steps / Action Items

### 1. Create Hero Illustration Image
Create or obtain an image file at:
```
public/images/illustrations/large/products/hero-products-experience.png
```
**Recommended specs:**
- Dimensions: 800x600px (will display at max 360px width)
- Theme: Show UI creation, plugins, or modern app interface

- Format: PNG with transparency preferred

### 2. Update Navigation Menu (if needed)
Check if Experience needs to be manually added to the products dropdown in:
```
site/src/layouts/Base.astro
```
Or relevant navigation component. The page should be automatically discoverable at `/products/experience/`.

### 3. Build and Test
```bash
# Navigate to site directory
cd C:\source\repos\empowernow_info\site

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Build the site
npm run build

# Or run dev server to preview
npm run dev
```

### 4. Add to Products Index (optional)
Consider adding Experience to the products listing page at:
```
site/src/pages/products/index.astro
```

### 5. Create Video Content (optional, for future)
Consider creating product videos to showcase:
- AI-driven plugin generation demo
- "Vibe coding" in action
- Security workflow demonstration

2. **Create a demo video**: A 90-second demo showing AI plugin generation would be very compelling

3. **Customer testimonials**: Add quotes from customers about development speed improvements

4. **Interactive demo**: Consider embedding an interactive plugin builder demo

5. **Comparison content**: Create detailed comparison pages (e.g., "Experience vs. Retool", "Experience vs. Internal Developer Portals")

6. **Case studies**: Document real customer implementations (Entra ID admin portal, custom dashboards, etc.)

7. **Plugin marketplace**: Eventually showcase available plugins or plugin templates
