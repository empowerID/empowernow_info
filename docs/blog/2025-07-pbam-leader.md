description: Analysis of the 2025 PBAM Leadership Compass and how EmpowerNowâ€™s Identity Fabric compares.
---

When KuppingerCole released the **2025 Leadership Compass for Policy-Based Access Management (PBAM)** this week, one pattern stood out: vendors who deliver dynamic, context-aware authorisation **as a service** scored dramatically higher than point solutions that bolt policy engines onto apps.

EmpowerNow landed in the **Leader quadrant across Product, Innovation and Overall**.  In this post weâ€™ll unpack what the analysts measured, why we scored where we did andâ€”the part architects care about mostâ€”how it translates into real-world design decisions.

## 1. Graph-native PBAC beats static ABAC

The report calls out EmpowerNowâ€™s Neo4j graph as a differentiator.  Delegation graphs let you model AI agents, SaaS integrations and human hierarchy without role-explosion.  At runtime the PDP resolves relationships in < 20 ms.

## 2. Fabric philosophy vs. policy islands

Most challengers still ship policy engines you must embed or call via Lambda.  That pushes complexity to each product team.  EmpowerNow externalises **Authentication + Authorisation + Workflow** into Fabric Servicesâ€”one place to govern, one audit trail.

## 3. Donâ€™t overlook inventory

Analysts focused on decision engines, but your policies are only as good as the identity data feeding them.  Our new **Inventory Studio** keeps Neo4j fresh with incremental deltas from any system (LDAP, REST, DB, SCIM).  Expect this to feature in next yearâ€™s Compass.

## 4. Where weâ€™re going

We briefed KC on our Governance roadmapâ€”access reviews, SoD campaigns, AI-generated policies.  Watch for an Executive View later this year.
