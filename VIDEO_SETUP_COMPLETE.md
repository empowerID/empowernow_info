# ✅ Video Setup Complete for Experience Page

## 🎬 Video File Connected!

Your video **"The_End_of_Forms.mp4"** is now connected to the Experience page in **two prominent locations**:

1. **Hero Section** (below CTAs): "See Experience in Action"
2. **Featured Video Section** (large showcase): "The End of Forms"

## 📁 Files in Place

✅ **Video File**: 
```
site/public/videos/products/experience/The_End_of_Forms.mp4
```

## 🖼️ Poster Image Needed (Optional)

Create a thumbnail image that will show before the video plays:

**Location**: 
```
site/public/images/video-placeholder/the-end-of-forms.jpg
```

**Specs**:
- Dimensions: 1280x720 pixels (16:9 ratio)
- Format: JPG
- Content: A frame from your video or a custom thumbnail showing:
  - "The End of Forms" title
  - Visual hint of content (UI transformation, forms breaking, etc.)
  - EmpowerNow branding

**Quick Option**: Extract a frame from the video:
```powershell
# Using ffmpeg (if installed)
cd C:\source\repos\empowernow_info\site\public\videos\products\experience
ffmpeg -i The_End_of_Forms.mp4 -ss 00:00:03 -vframes 1 ..\..\images\video-placeholder\the-end-of-forms.jpg
```

**Note**: If no poster image exists, the video player will show the first frame of the video automatically - so this is optional!
