## 🔗 URLs

Once built and deployed, the page will be accessible at:

**Production**: `https://empowernow.ai/products/experience/`

**Local Dev**: `http://localhost:4321/products/experience/`

## ⚡ Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Create Hero Illustration Image 🎨
**REQUIRED**: Create or obtain the hero illustration:

**Path**: `site/public/images/illustrations/large/products/hero-products-experience.png`

**Specs**:
- Dimensions: 800x600px (displays at max 360px width, so prioritize clarity)
- Theme ideas:
  - AI/robot hand crafting UI components
  - Plugin puzzle pieces connecting
  - Modern app interface with "wow" sparkles
  - Split screen: old rigid forms vs. new flexible UI
- Style: Match Neon Flux design system (cyberpunk, gradient glows, violet/cyan colors)
- Format: PNG with transparency preferred

**Quick Option**: You could use one of these placeholders temporarily:
```bash
# Copy an existing illustration as a placeholder
cp site/public/images/illustrations/large/products/hero-products-aria-shield.png site/public/images/illustrations/large/products/hero-products-experience.png
```

### 1b. Create Demo Videos 🎥 (Optional but Recommended)

The page now includes **5 prominent video embed spots**:

**Video Files Needed**:
```
site/public/videos/products/experience/
├── Experience_Demo.mp4              (Hero section - main demo)
├── AI_Plugin_Generation_Demo.mp4   (Featured - Entra ID build)
├── Vibe_Coding_Demo.mp4             (Grid - plain language AI)
├── Security_Demo.mp4                (Grid - BFF/PDP/zero-token)
└── Plugin_Deployment_Demo.mp4       (Grid - deployment workflow)
```

**Video Poster Images** (thumbnails shown before play):
```

├── experience-demo-placeholder.jpg
├── ai-plugin-demo.jpg
├── vibe-coding-demo.jpg
├── security-demo.jpg
└── plugin-deployment-demo.jpg
```

**Video Specs**:
- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9
- Duration: 1-3 minutes each
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 1280x720

**Content Ideas**:
1. **Experience_Demo.mp4**: Quick overview showing plugin generation
2. **AI_Plugin_Generation_Demo.mp4**: Screen recording of building Entra ID admin portal with AI
3. **Vibe_Coding_Demo.mp4**: Show developer typing "make it more wow" and UI transforming
4. **Security_Demo.mp4**: Walkthrough of BFF, PDP decisions, and zero-token architecture
5. **Plugin_Deployment_Demo.mp4**: Show plugin upload, validation, and instant quarantine

**Note**: The page will work without videos - they'll show as placeholder boxes. Videos can be added later!
